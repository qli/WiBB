### Data
- full_datasets: independent datasets for three correlation structures ($\delta$r = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3; 200 datasets for each; sample size = 1000);
- sub_datasets: resampled datasets with varying sample sizes from the full datasets for fitting LM and GLM separately;
- fit_result: example LM and GLM fitting results with the sample size = 1000;
- empirical_dataset: 71 *Mimulus* species occurrence data and background locality data (randomly sampled from the overall distribution) and associated climatic data;

### R scripts

- Rscripts_1_data_simulation.R: data simulation
- Rscripts_2_analysis.R: model fitting and metric calculation
- Rscripts_3_empirical_dataset.R: application on *Mimulus*
